# rj-charcounter - Simple input character counter

rj-charcounter displays dynamically how many characters are in `<input>` text element. It also shows max amount of characters allowed in `<input>`. Counter works on basis of "maxlength" attribute placed in `<input>` element. 
This plugin has been created for one of my commercial projects.

## How to use

1. Upload CSS and JS files to your project
2. Add proper links to files in your HTML
3. Provide value of "maxlength" attribute in your `<input>` element. This is essential to get plugin working
4. As the plugin works automatically when it detects HTML element with `rj-charcounter` class, the only thing left is to put this class in your `<input>` elements. e.g: `<input type="text" class="rj-charcounter" maxlength="20">`
